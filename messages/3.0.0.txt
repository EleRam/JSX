JSX 3.0.0 - Rewrite
===================

* Completely re-written in ST3's new `.sublime-syntax` (Sorry ST2)
* Fixed the problems around nesting JSX in JSX (It's way more robust) (Pesky quotes/props wont break everything)
* Cleaned up syntax scope naming to be closer to: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html (Check the readme for more infomation)

Be sure to make issues (or shout at me) for broken things:
